What happened here? Oh the carnage! Why did mushroom Dave attack me?"

It wasn't just mushroom Dave!
 
Mushroom Becky, mushroom Emile... What's going on?

What... where? Wait, what's this? A Special Weapon?!
I can use this to control time and gravity!

What I wouldn't give for ice skates...
I suppose it's just as well, since I have no feet.

That one orange guy isn't fooled by my feigning death.
Maybe he has had his intelligence artificially augmented?
I wonder if that's connected to the eerie, insane, maniacal laughter I heard earlier...

I notice many of the mushrooms in the cemetery are missing slices of flesh.
How barbaric!
 
 
(Offscreen) Muahahaha... OM NOM NOM... ahahahahahaha!
            Soon my stew will have the perfect balance of flavors!
            Now, where did I put that garlic...

(Offscreen) Ah, yes, the tenacity and resilience of the red mushroom
            should spice the stew perfectly!
            It holds its structure, resisting almost every attempt
            to overpower the flavor!
            Muahahahahahahahaha!

Will I... no, will mushroom-kind... ever be the same?
What has happened to my people? My tasty, tasty people?
 
 
(Offscreen) Muahahahahahahaha! 
            Now my stew will be complete, with this earthy, hardy variety!
            Come, little mushroom, come meet your DOOM!

(Evil chef) *Cough cough*...
            You've defeated me, little fungus, and I breathe my last...
            I regret nothing...
            *cough cough*
            *dies*
 
 
Mushroom justice prevails, even without garlic, evil nemesis!
I return to my people a hero!
